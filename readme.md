# Pardot Tracking - GET Request

This Google Tag Manager template makes a GET request to the Pardot analytics endpoint to track analytics data. This is mostly needed for managing the cookie consent for the visitors of a website when Pardot tracking is aligned with anohter consent management platform.

The functionality of the template is similar to how the original pd.js script works. This just doesn't require loading the script.
